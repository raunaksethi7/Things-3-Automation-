This is a series of Shortcuts that I use to control Things 3 via their URL Scheme. Each shortcut page also has the instrctions for setup. Almost all of these uses the free app Data Jar to have outside storage of variables. DataJar is used so you can easily change the tasks and ID's without having to mess with Shortcuts.
